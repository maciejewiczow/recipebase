And not at all difficult to get looking this gorgeous with the help of a cake ring and some acetate. Anyone can make this layer cake! It&#8217;s not just for skilled cake decorators. Although the recipe is lengthy, and there are a few different pieces you need to make before you start assembling (chocolate cake, cherry filling, whipped cream, chocolate ganache), once you&#8217;ve got them all together it&#8217;s as simple as layering once on top of the other. You don&#8217;t even need to be neat.&nbsp;</p><div class='code-block code-block-1' style='margin: 8px auto; text-align: center; display: block; clear: both;'>

<p>If you&#8217;re going to make one layer cake anytime soon, I really think this should be it.&nbsp;</p>
<h2>Let&#8217;s get naked</h2>
<p>Never made a naked cake before? Me neither. I&#8217;ve always been a keen frosting-all-over sort of girl, which is a little weird seeing as neither myself or my wife are super into icing. But I was inspired by this <a href="https://www.browneyedbaker.com/smores-layer-cake/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">S&#8217;mores Layer Cake from Brown Eyed Baker</a> (which is one of the most heart-eyes-emoji cakes you&#8217;ve&nbsp; ever seen, right?) to give this naked &#8220;Milk Bar&#8221; style cake a try.&nbsp;</p>
<p>Plus, I&#8217;ve just ordered the <a href="https://amzn.to/2CMw1Fo" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Milk Bar cookbook from Amazon</a>, so I&#8217;m sure there will be many more Momofuku-inspired recipes heading your way very soon.&nbsp;</p>
<p>Apart from the lack of frosting, naked cakes are great for people who don&#8217;t have time time or attention-to-detail to spend hours intricately frosting a layer cake with completely smooth buttercream and piped decorations. They look stylish and beautiful, but the only effort I put into decorating this cake was adding a mound of fresh cherries to the top. Honest!</p><div class='code-block code-block-2' style='margin: 8px auto; text-align: center; display: block; clear: both;'>

<h2>What is a Milk Bar cake anyway?</h2>
<p>The <a href="https://milkbarstore.com/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Momofuku Milk Bar</a> is a US bakery that is most famously located in New York City. Even though I&#8217;ve spent way too many (but still not quite enough) holidays in NYC, I&#8217;ve never actually been to Milk Bar. But you don&#8217;t have to have walked through the doors to know that they are synonymous with two things: cereal milk and naked layer cakes.&nbsp; And as we&#8217;ve been <a href="https://whatcharlottebaked.com/2018/07/21/lucky-charms-cereal-milk-ice-cream/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">down the cereal milk route before</a>, it seemed only fair to give the layer cake a go.&nbsp;</p><div class='code-block code-block-3' style='margin: 8px auto; text-align: center; display: block; clear: both;'>

<p>As mentioned above, there are a few simple parts to this black forest naked cake, which all come together to make something pretty special. Let&#8217;s start with the chocolate cake shall we?</p>
<h2>Hang on, the cake&#8217;s not round?</h2>
<p>The most important thing to note when it comes to the chocolate cake is that you&#8217;re not going to bake three 6 inch chocolate cakes. Instead, we&#8217;re going to do things the Milk Bar way, and bake one large sheet cake which is going to get cut up into two 6 inch circles. The remaining off-cuts from the sheet cake are going to be put together like a jigsaw to make the bottom layer of the cake.&nbsp;</p>
<p>Does this sound a bit mad? Yes. But does it absolutely work? HELL YES.&nbsp;</p>
<p>Here&#8217;s a little guide to the way I found easiest to cut up the cake &#8211; using my 6 inch cake ring as a template:</p>

<p>When it comes to the actual cake recipe, there&#8217;s nothing difficult or time consuming here. The Milk Bar recipe book would tell you to make your own chocolate fudge sauce to add to the batter, but I&#8217;m just going to tell you to buy it store bought. In my opinion, homemade chocolate fudge sauce adds nothing earth-shattering to the table, so why add the extra step? I&#8217;m all about minimising effort wherever possible, as long as it doesn&#8217;t compromise on taste, of course.&nbsp;</p>

<h2>So. Many. Layers</h2>
<p>There are three (!) different layers of filling between each of the three cakes. First up you&#8217;ve got some good old <strong>dark chocolate ganache</strong>. This helps to add chocolatey flavour, but also keeps the <strong>homemade&nbsp;cherry filling</strong> from making the cake layer beneath it too soggy.&nbsp;</p>
<p>And then there&#8217;s the <strong>whipped cream</strong>, which cuts through the sweetness and lightens things up a little bit. And you can&#8217;t really have a black forest cake without whipped cream, can you. That&#8217;s not a question &#8211; you can&#8217;t.&nbsp;</p>
<p>There&#8217;s no waiting around between layers either &#8211; spread the ganache out, then add the cherries, and go straight in with the whipped cream. They&#8217;re going to get mushed together a little, but that&#8217;s okay. It will still look beautiful!</p>
<h2>What about the kirsch?&nbsp;</h2>
<p>Ah yes, you&#8217;ve got to have kirsch in a black forest naked cake. Or do you?&nbsp;</p>
<p>If you&#8217;ve got some to hand (like I had) then add it to some cherry juice and drizzle it over each of the chocolate cake layers before you add the ganache. If you don&#8217;t have any, don&#8217;t want to buy any, or don&#8217;t want to use alcohol at all, then just use cherry juice. You can find it at the supermarket with all the other juices, and it definitely helps keep things from being even slightly too dry.&nbsp;</p>

<h2>Special Equipment Alert!</h2>
<p>I like to be honest with you guys wherever possible, and this black forest naked cake is going to need a few special bits of equipment which you might not already own. I had to go out and buy a 6 inch cake ring, which you&#8217;ll definitely need to construct this layer cake in. You could use a 6 inch springform tin as well &#8211; the key is to have straight deep edges and a removable base and sides. This is <a href="https://amzn.to/2RcN20q" target="_blank" rel="noopener">the one I used</a> &#8211; and it&#8217;s extra helpful as you can change the size up from 6 inches to 12 inches (<a href="https://amzn.to/2Mviiab">US version here</a>).&nbsp;</p>
<p>Six inches sounds like a teeny tiny cake, but once you&#8217;ve layered all the fillings and cake on top of each other, this will easily serve 10 or 12 people. And the whipped cream isn&#8217;t going to keep for more than a couple of days, so you&#8217;re not going to want tonnes of leftovers lying around. Who am I kidding? This cake doesn&#8217;t <em>do</em> leftovers.&nbsp;</p>
<p>You&#8217;re also going to need some baking acetate to add height to your 6 inch cake ring, as this cake will be at least 6 or 7 inches tall once you&#8217;ve finished layering up. This is <a href="https://amzn.to/2CSLjIL" target="_blank" rel="noopener">the roll I purchased</a>, and it worked like a charm (<a href="https://amzn.to/2Mu52mm" target="_blank" rel="noopener">US version here</a>).&nbsp;</p>
<p>And that&#8217;s about it. Pop your black forest naked cake on a cute cake stand (mine is from H&amp;M) and you&#8217;ve got yourself the naked cake of your dreams. Would make a fantastic birthday cake, or even as part of a wedding dessert table, don&#8217;t you think?</p>

Once happy, spoon two tablespoons of the cherry drizzle over this cake layer, trying to make sure the whole cake layer is moist.&nbsp;</span></div></li><li id="wprm-recipe-3541-step-5-4" class="wprm-recipe-instruction" style="list-style-type: decimal;"><div class="wprm-recipe-instruction-text" style="margin-bottom: 5px"><span style="display: block;">Spoon approximately one third of the chocolate ganache onto the cake layer, and spread evenly. Make sure the ganache gets right to the edges of the cake. Spoon half of the cherry filling on top of the ganache and spread out evenly, again making sure to get right up to the edges. Finally, gently spoon half of the whipped cream on top of the cherry layer, spreading out gently to the edges of the cake, trying to avoid mixing with the cherry layer underneath.

Drizzle the cake circle with the one or two tablespoons of cherry drizzle - don't use it all if you don't think it's needed. Spoon the last third of the ganache on top of the cake and spread out as before - you've done this enough times to know what you're doing by now!</span></div></li><li id="wprm-recipe-3541-step-5-8" class="wprm-recipe-instruction" style="list-style-type: decimal;"><div class="wprm-recipe-instruction-text" style="margin-bottom: 5px"><span style="display: block;">Place the cake (still on the board/plate/sheet) in to the freezer for 12 hours. This will help join all the various cake and filling layers together. You can leave the assembled cake in the freezer for up to two weeks if needed. Once ready to serve, remove from the cake from the freezer, and gently remove the cake ring and acetate from it.
